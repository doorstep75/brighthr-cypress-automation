# QA Bug / Query Log

> Purpose: a lightweight, versioned list of issues spotted during exploratory and automation test authoring
> Accepted that sandbox envs may not include full UX/customer experience
> Accepted that many/all of these may have been previously discussed and considered and outcomes already set up or accepted
> Outcome of discussions would determine if bugs or stories with further detail would be written up
> I was more just trying to demonstrate my observational skills ðŸ˜Š
